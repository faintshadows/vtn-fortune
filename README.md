a fortune-mod pack with quotes from a vintage rare telegram group

I wanted a somewhat easy way to get used to using git/GitHub, without
needing to also know how to code. So I decided to make my sticker pack
of a vintage rare telegram group into fun fortune-mod fortunes.

**Hey watch out, many of these fortunes are lewd in nature**
You may want to put these in the `off` folder for your fortunes, just
to be sure while I go about separating them.
