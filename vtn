(Power Shift)

Starting today some things have changed
The workstation world will be rearranged

Hewlett Packard is not made the same
PA-RISC is what we mean

Workin' fast will be the norm
New applications can now be born

'Cause the hottest desktop in the world
A brand new era we've unfurled

[Chorus]
You want power
You want speed

The 700 Series is what you need
PA-RISC has set the pace
Hewlett Packard now leads the race

The Series 700 is the name
Leaders in the work-station game

720, 730, 750, too
Supercharging all you'll ever need to do

For designing, mapping
Making chips
Software engineering or trading tips
A.I. knowledge and database
Molecular modeling in cyberspace

[Chorus]

The power's shifting at your door
By any measure brother, you'll get more

MIPS, SPECs, we've hit the mark
We're leaving other systems in the dark

And don't forget those megaflops
We're crunching those numbers, staying on top

Blinding speed at warp factor 9
These machines will definitely save your time

[Chorus]

OSF is where we'll be
Multi-windows and the DCE

Distributed computing at its best
NCS, (Stats Broker?), and all the rest

Team together on your LAN
New wave computing, 'cause that's the plan

Open Systems is the way
Tomorrow's standards are here today

[Chorus x2]

PaperKup: it's 2007 and little Jimmy asked his grandma if he can have GTA IV
for his birthday, grandma had heard it from fox news that this wsa no good,
immoral violent stuff. So she gets him "Shreks Swamp Sanity". The box says
you have to help Shrek solve puzzles to fix his swamp. Of course little Jimmy
isn't impressed. They don't understand. Jimmy loves shrek so why wouldn't he
like this? His parents force him to install it and play it for grandma.
Surprisingly Jimmy takes a shine to it after a while. They're pleased he's
spending time on an educational game so leave him to it. He comes down for
dinner, is polite but always leaves as soon as he can. They realise he's
doing nothing but playing the Shrek game. Mom checks in on him, peeks through
the door and shrek is staring directly at her saying BITCH BITCH BITCH over
and over, as soon as she walks in it changes to BENCH BENCH BENCH and jimmy
is dropping benches around a map of the swamp. Jimmy just stares at her and
she leaves. A few days later pop gets up to use the bathroom at 3am, he hears
voices so just stops and listens outside Jimmys door. Shrek is saying
"You see the kikes run everything they dont care about the likes us in the
swamp. They are the enemy." Pop is horrified but decides to wait until morning:
then he's taking this game away and making a call to corporate. They don't see
the morning though. They wake up bound and gagged and they hear shrek say
"What kind of sick parent would take away Shrek from their kid?" Jimmy then
beats them in the face with his bare hands until they pass out.

The investigation leads to Sundial Interactive, a long dissolved company, based
in India with no records of employees or their activity. A deep dive into the
decompiled game reveals that significant portions of the code for interacting
with shrek were lifted straight from the US government: an inquiry reveals
that this code was an abandoned CIA project for deepfake AIs that were to be
used on chat roulette to identify potential domestic terror threats.

Leon: "I use Linux as my operating system," I state proudly to the unkempt,
bearded man. He swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish gleam in his
eyes, ready to mansplain with extreme precision. "Actually", he says with a
grin, "Linux is just the kernel. You use GNU+Linux!' I don't miss a beat and
reply with a smirk, "I use Alpine, a distro that doesn't include the
GNU Coreutils, or any other GNU code. It's Linux, but it's not GNU+Linux."

The smile quickly drops from the man's face. His body begins convulsing and
he foams at the mouth and drops to the floor with a sickly thud. As he
writhes around he screams "I-IT WAS COMPILED WITH GCC! THAT MEANS IT'S STILL
GNU!" Coolly, I reply "If windows were compiled with GCC, would that make it
GNU?" I interrupt his response with "-and work is being made on the kernel to
make it more compiler-agnostic. Even if you were correct, you won't be
for long."

With a sickly wheeze, the last of the man's life is ejected from his body.
He lies on the floor, cold and limp. I've womansplained him to death.
